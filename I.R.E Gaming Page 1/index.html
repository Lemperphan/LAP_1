                From the very first punch, Sifu is utterly uncompromising in its design. Absolver developer Sloclap's
                latest martial arts beat-em-up is bold, its combat exquisite, its animation top-notch, its music
                outstanding, and its story - while very simple . is poignant and elegantly told. It's also unforgiving
                and unapologetic, with pockets of frustrating moments during which I was certainly not in my happy
                place. But by the end, Sifu offered me a nearly unparalleled sense of mastery and accomplishment, and I
                can't imagine that I would've enjoyed it half as much if it pulled its punches.

                Sifu begins, as so many revenge-fueled martial arts stories do, with a murder. Your father and martial
                arts master is killed right before your eyes in what is quite simply one of the best prologue chapters
                I've played in recent memory. It both serves as an excellent tutorial, and a teases at what the future
                holds for you as you have full access to the entire catalog of unlockable moves. Eight years later, you
                set off on a journey to kill each of the five people involved.

                Sifu's martial arts combat is among the best I've ever played, plain and simple. The camera does
                sometimes get squished in the corner and makes it hard to see what's coming, but apart from that it's
                hard to find many faults. I can't say enough good things about how smooth the animation is, how every
                hit lands with bone-crunching impact (which is wonderfully emphasized by the DualSense controller's
                haptics if you're playing on PlayStation 5) and how every single counter looks natural no matter what
                angle an attack comes from or what type of strike is thrown. That's just talking on a purely surface
                level; mechanically, it's just as impressive.

                The original Subnautica is one of those games I wish I could wipe from my memory so that I could plunge
                in and comb its depths for the first time all over again. No one's worked out how to do that without
                some pretty severe side effects, but Subnautica: Below Zero is the next best thing: even though it's a
                bit smaller, it gives us a whole new watery sector to explore, survive, craft, and build awesome bases
                in, and it's just as exhilarating.

                Returning to the mostly submerged alien world of 4546B some time after the events of Subnautica, Below
                Zero tells a more personal and emotional story. You are Robin Ayou, a sharp, defiant xenobiologist
                searching for her sister after the Alterra corporation pronounced her dead in an accident. And what kind
                of rube trusts a faceless megacorporation to tell the truth, especially in the future? There are more
                strange, alien mysteries to discover, including a lot more about the enigmatic Architects. This is all
                accompanied by excellent voice acting that will lead you on a bread crumb trail toward the truth.

                And of course, Unknown Worlds' art direction continues to be astounding. With several new land and
                underwater biomes to explore, I was filled with wonder as I navigated the tangled passages of the Twisty
                Bridges or swam alongside alien wales in the Fallen Lily Pads. The use of color and shape gives such a
                strong identity to each area and creature, with instantly recognizable and memorable silhouettes for
                important landmarks and species. It's just a beautiful, beautiful game. And the jarring texture pop-in
                from the original Subnautica seems to be all but extinct, though I did still run into it in a couple
                areas, like around the edges of icebergs.

                Ever since Assassin's Creed started leaping from ancient Jerusalem to renaissance Italy to colonial
                America and beyond, there has been a longstanding itch to see the open-world stealth-action series take
                on feudal Japan. Consider that itch sufficiently scratched with Ghost of Tsushima. Sucker Punch's latest
                is an absolutely gorgeous adventure through one of history's most strikingly beautiful landscapes, and
                that beauty is compounded by one of the best blade-to-blade combat systems the open-world action genre
                has seen. There are some stumbles when it comes to stealth, enemy AI, and a few general minor
                frustrations, but for just about every moment where Ghost of Tsushima falters, there are plenty more
                where it soars.

                Ghost of Tsushima is a fictional tale told with fictional characters, but it's based on the very real
                invasion of Japan by the Mongol Empire in 1274 that began on the Island of Tsushima. You take control of
                Jin Sakai, capably acted by The Man in the High Castle's Daisuke Tsuji, who starts off as a samurai
                before a disastrous battle against the invaders quickly teaches him that perhaps the honorable but
                restrictive ways of the samurai code might not be enough to deal with this new and existential threat.

            <p>
                Ghost of Tsushima's combat is like a witches' brew made with bits of the Batman Arkham series, the
                pre-Origins Assassin's Creeds, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and the entire library of Kurosawa films. And,
                as witches' brews tend to be, the result is magical. Like all great combat systems, it's simple to
                understand on a surface level: there are light attacks to quickly deal damage and beat out slower
                strikes, heavy attacks that deal more damage and can break through enemy guards, a block button to guard
                against certain attacks, and a dodge button to avoid the attacks that can't be guarded.

                That probably all sounds familiar, but the glue that holds this combat system together and allows it to
                remain interesting the whole way through is the addition of the stances you can shift between at the
                push of a button. As Jin completes certain tasks, he'll unlock new sword stances that each come with
                their own movesets, and, more importantly, their own strengths versus a particular type of weapon. The
                starting Stone Stance is ideal for dealing with swordsmen, as one charged-up stab attack can sneak
                through their guard and either kill them outright or deal massive damage. Later on you'll learn the
                Water Stance, which uses slower but more powerful strikes that can break through the defenses of
                shield-wielding enemies.


                There are four stances total, and once you have access to them all combat will challenge you to not only
                identify the greatest threat at any given moment but also to swap to the stance that is best suited to
                deal with them, all while balancing the very real need to play defensively. When it's at its best,
                combat in Ghost of Tsushima is fast, chaotic, tactical, and is true to the fantasy of being a lone
                hyper-skilled but outnumbered samurai.
